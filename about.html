                <p>Hey! This is Owen! I’m a junior BSI student focusing on UX track. I like many different genres of music, like R&B, Jazz, Indie, and Pop. One of my favourite albums is ‘Ryo Fukui in New York’ by Ryo Fukui, which is a great album for people to chill and relax. You can also check out other my top albums from my music selections page. By the way, ‘Angel Disco Love’ by Sunset Rollercoaster is a good song you can check that out from Vivian’s page! Enjoy!</p>

                <p>Hello! My name is Vivian and I am currently a junior at UMSI studying UX Design. I enjoy various genres of music including Indie, Pop, and K-R&B (Korean R&B). My favourite album from my music page is 'Weather Report' by Slom, which was recently released this past month. It is a collaboration album with the many greats of K-R&B artists in South Korea such as Crush, Loco, and Zion.T. I would highly recommend this and 海浪 (Waves) by Deca Joins from one of Owen's favorite albums, 'Go Slow'.</p>
